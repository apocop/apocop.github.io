## Unicode Decode

[Unicode Decode](https://unicodedecode.com) is a tool designed to make dissecting a unicode string and the characters that compose it simple. Just paste the string into the search box and press **Enter** or click **Search** to see an itemized list of every letter in the string and to see if it's [normalized](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/).

#### Highlights 
* character by character breakdown
* string normalization standards
* chararacter stats page

Feel free to contribute on the project's [github](https://github.com/apocop/unicodedecode).
