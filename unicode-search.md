## Unicode Search

Tentatively named: Unicode Search

[Unicode Search](https://github.com/apocop/unicode) is a tool designed to make dissecting a unicode string and the characters that compose it as easy as possible. Just paste the string into the search box and press **Enter** or click **Search** to see an itemized list of every letter in the string and to see if it's [normalized](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/).

Made in Python, using the Django framework, start a new project add the [module](https://github.com/apocop/unicode) and test it out. The project is tentatively planned to offically launch in December 2019.
