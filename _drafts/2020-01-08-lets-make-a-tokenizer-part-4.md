### Tokenizer

Congratulations for making it to the last post in making a tokenizer. Let's
jump right in. And bring in our imports.  We'll be making use of the `re`
library along to the `exceptions.py` and `grammar.py` we made earlier.

```
import re
import exceptions
import gramma
```

Let's define a tokenizer class scaffolding and outline the class methods. 
Generally *methods* are functions that defined inside a class.

```
class Tokenizer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __add_exception(self):
        pass

    def __tokenize_pipeline(self):
        pass

    def tokenize(self):
        pass
```


< The double-underscore in `__tokenize_pipeline` indicate that they are private
methods. Whoever uses this class should only use the `tokenize` method. Private
just means they are for internal use inside the class. Let's look into these
methods a little more deeply.

* `__tokenize_pipeline` - Check each token against the rule, breaking it up if
it doesn't pass and recursively call itself on the smaller tokens.

* `tokenize` The only public function. Returns a list of tokens.


### Instance Variables.

So let's modify the the `__init__` method create a few variables on
instantiation. 

```
def __init__(self):
    self.rules = grammar.RULES
    self.rule_list = list(grammar.RULES)
    self.exception_lexicon = exceptions.LEXICON
    self.accepted_tokens = None
```

Notice we're importing our grammar rules and exceptions list lexicon into the
tokenizer.  We also create a variable that will eventually hold our tokens,
`accepted_tokens`.  Accepted meaning, that the token either was in our lexicon
of exceptions or passed every rule defined in our grammar. Notice that we also
generate a list from our grammar rules. This list is in order the order they
were added, thus the order in which they will be applied.










# Suggestions for Future Edits

1. Add support for borrowed words like cafÃ©.  How many diacritics does
English usually import?

2. Allow for English plural possessives.
