Pynini compiles grammars into weighted finite state transducers.

### Installing Pynini
The easiest way to install Pynini is to use a Linux machine and the Anaconda
Python package manager.

```
conda install -c conda-forge
```

If you'd like to install Pynini on Windows, there's a different approach, see
